          <h2>Aim</h2>
          <p>This webpage provides a visual representation of the impact of the pandemic on merger and acquisition activity around the world through data visualisations. It aims to provide insights for understanding the economic impacts of COVID-19.</p>
          <h2>Analysis</h2>
          <div class="chart" id="pro1"></div>
          <a rel="stylesheet" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XH_T5m23H7v0PdUcu2i5jJMi6YvQKGae" target="_blank">Google Colab 1</a>
          <p>Global M&A activity was highest in the Americas before COVID, with EMEA following. After COVID, the number of deals in the Americas decreased but has since increased, while the EMEA region saw a decrease in 2021 and a significant increase in 2022. The APAC region saw stable activity, with a slight increase in 2021 and 2022. These results show a rebound in activity post-COVID.</p>
          <div class="chart" id="pro2"></div>
          <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RFwTIKcQTXu7QK86sdF1VNnbHVJQz-8Z" target="_blank">Google Colab 2</a>
          <p>The data suggests that certain sectors, such as financials and TMT, have consistently seen higher levels of M&A activity, while others, such as agriculture and construction, had less activity. It's also noteworthy that some sectors, such as pharma, medical, and biotech, have seen increased activity post-COVID after an initial drop. Defence saw the largest proportional drop during Covid.</p>
          <div class="chart" id="pro3"></div>
          <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Qfz57Td7EJ4alxJVuo0PBCC65t23YrsW" target="_blank">Google Colab 3</a>
          <p>Comparied to the previous visualisation, sectors with a higher representation in public markets, such as industrials and TMT, tend towards higher levels of M&A activity. Sectors with smaller market representation, such as real estate and financials, have less M&A activity. Key note- M&A activity is influenced by other factors.</p>

          <p>Both the above visualisations include a regression line showing the trend of M&A deals over time. The first visualisation shows a slight increase in M&A deal values post-COVID, while the second visualisation shows a steadier trend of deal values pre-COVID, indicating Covid-19s potential positive impact on individual deal value.</p>

          <p>The dendrogram shows clusters of stock prices for 9 financial institutions from 2017-2022 (December), grouped BB: GS, MS JPM. MM:MAC, HLI, SF. EB: LAZ, EVR, and MC. The dynamic time warping technique was used to better identify similarities in trends. </p>
          <p>We see that, excluding JPM and SF, the bank categories are well maintained, indicating the groups are affected categorically differently. The shape of each is pretty similar. The first dip indicates Covid-19. Pre-covid there was steady growth however, afterwards there's steeper growth before a slight decrease.</p>

          <p>This chart aims to test if institutions, whom perform M&A deals, employees base salary got impacted by Covid. The data suggests there has been a general trend of salary growth for most firms and seniority levels, post-covid. Although the extent of this growth varies between firms and levels.</p>

          <h3>Chord Chart representing flows of cross continental border M&A deals</h3>
          <p>Source : S&P Global IQ Pro</p>
          <p>***The default slider year is 2017***</p>
          <p>The slider shows chords from buyer regions to seller regions. Hover over the chords for tooltips showing the number of deals and direction of the flows.</p>
          <p>Cross-border M&A deals, a small part of the overall M&A market, may've been impacted by travel restrictions due to Covid-19. The USA, Canada, and Europe typically see more activity. A decrease was seen in such deals in 2020, but 2021 saw a rebound, particularly in the USA and Canada.</p>

          <h2>Accessing Data and Challenges in Cleaning and Analysis</h2>
          <p>Given Covid-19 is a historical event I haven't used API's as it would eventually neglect the primary focus of impacts of Covid-19. My most prevalent source was S&P Global IQ Pro CSV's.</p>
          <p>The maps data was gathered as a geojson and 2 CSV files, the CSVs were cleaned and merged. Difficulty arose when transforming the data after a slider change. Reformatting the vega-lite json solved this issue.</p>
          <p>The data for the heat map was scraped from a html from Statista, then cleaned and I added a selector to see each sector more clearly.</p>
          <p>Data for the market composition chart was scraped from S&P Global IQ Pro and companiesmarketcap.com which was cleaned utilising loops and then concatenated to one data-frame.</p>
          <p>Cleaning the data of symbols using lambda and covering only the bottom 95% values allowed the graph to show data on the y-axis up to 800 rather than 8000, making the trend line distinguishable between the 2 comparative charts.</p>
          <p>The dendrogram was created using unsupervised learning. The data was cleaned utilising loops, then dynamically time warped to cluster the data more effectively, which was from the yfinance API.</p>
          <p>The data was scraped from a pdf which required using tabula. Then using for loops and split, cleaned the data. Presenting the data in vega-lite involved using layers to attain the graphs appearance.</p>
          <p>Creating the SVG chord chart used JavaScript d3blocks. After switching from holoviews in Python, I created a chart with chords, tooltips, labels and ticks. I encountered difficulties with the slider, consequently creating a separate JavaScript file for each instance, selecting the chart with if statements. Cleaning the data required loops, pivot tables, and converting it into JavaScript-readable matrices using json dumps.</p>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>From the visualisations presented we can see Covid-19 has impacted the M&A landscape, globally to individual sectors right down to employees salaries. Generally recovery from Covid-19 in the M&A industry has bounced back strongly. Further work can be done on this such as looking into how deal time was impacted by the lockdowns ect.</p>
